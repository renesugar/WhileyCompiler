/**

 * types are seen as sets containing their possible values as elements. For
 * example, the type <code>int</code> would correspond to the set of all
 * possible integer values. Then, one type is a subtype another if the set it
 * corresponds to is a subset of the other's corresponding set.

	 * Determine whether the <code>rhs</code> type is a <i>subtype</i> of the
	 * <code>lhs</code> (denoted <code>lhs :> rhs</code>). In the presence of type
	 * invariants, this operation is undecidable. Therefore, a <i>three-valued</i>
	 * logic is employed. Either it was concluded that the subtype relation
	 * <i>definitely holds</i>, or that it <i>definitely does not hold</i> that it
	 * is <i>unknown</i> whether it holds or not.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * For example, <code>int|null :> int</code> definitely holds. Likewise,
	 * <code>int :> int|null</code> definitely does not hold. However, whether or
	 * not <code>nat :> pos</code> holds depends on the type invariants given for
	 * <code>nat</code> and <code>pos</code> which this operator cannot reason
	 * about. Observe that, in some cases, we do get effective reasoning about types
	 * with invariants. For example, <code>null|nat :> nat</code> will be determined
	 * to definitely hold, despite the fact that <code>nat</code> has a type
	 * invariant.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Depending on the exact language of types involved, this can be a surprisingly
	 * complex operation. For example, in the presence of <i>union</i>,
	 * <i>intersection</i> and <i>negation</i> types, the subtype algorithm is
	 * surprisingly intricate.
