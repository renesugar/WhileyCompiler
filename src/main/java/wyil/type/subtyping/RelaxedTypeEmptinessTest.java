/**
 * <p>
 * Provides a relaxation of the <code>StrictSubtypeOperator</code> which
 * corresponds with the notion of subtyping used at the Whiley source level.
 * Under this intepration, for example, "<code>{int x, int y}</code>" is
 * equivalent to "<code>{int y, int x}</code>". Likewise,
 * "<code>{int x, int y}</code>" is considered a subtype of
 * "<code>{int x}</code>". Finally, "<code>int:8</code>" is considered
 * equivalent to "<code>int:16</code>".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this operator (compared with the strict operator) is to enable
 * intuitive subtyping relationships whilst preventing non-sensical ones. In
 * practice, however, some of these intuitive relationships are rejected by the
 * strict operator. What this means is that, under the hood, some kind of
 * representation conversion will be required for one type to flow into the
 * other. The exact details of this, however, depend on the backend in question.
 * In some backends (e.g. JavaScript) relatively few transformations are
 * required. In others (e.g. C), much more emphasis is placed on exact data
 * layout and, hence, many more conversions between layouts are required.
 * </p>
